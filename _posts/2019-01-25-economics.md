1. $U(q_i,q_j,u_i,u_j)=a(q_i+q_j)-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{q_i^2}{u_i^2}+\frac{q_j^2}{ u_j^2}+2\gamma\frac{q_i}{u_i}\frac{q_j}{u_j})$

MWG: Individual Decision Making

Because individual consumers own and run firms and therefore ultimately determine a firm's action, 
they are in a sense the more fundamental element of an economic model.

An interesting case: Legalization of Marijuana

- In the case of marijuana (or on the context of exhaustible resource extraction)  
Both policy-makers and monopolists have incentive to redece supply.  

Effects of egalization of marijuana:  
(1) More consumption of Marijuana (Not a good thing)  
(2) Selling marijuana becomes more competitive (probably less violence and fewer gangs)  
(3) Taxes create a new source of government revenue that could do good.  
(4) Clinics for marijuana addicts  

Policy concerns:
One problem associated with high tax on marijuana consumption is that it cannot eliminate black markets. However, experience we've learned from legalizing alchohol and tabacoo says tax rate could be raised to a very high level without serious black market problem.
