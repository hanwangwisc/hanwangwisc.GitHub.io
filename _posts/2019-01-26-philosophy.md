Karl Popper, Conjectures and Refutations: the Growth of Scientific Knowledge

Introduction- On sources of knowledge and ignorance  

- In this essay, Popper criticised that the doctrine of manifest truth (represented by Bacon and Descartes) was a false epistemology. By saying truth is manifest, he means that truth, if put before us naked, is always recognizable as truth.

- The main point he made in this introduction is to illustrate "sources of ignorance" ( "... I fear, to offend some critical ears..." ). He mentioned a critique from a friend of him: ignorance is the absence of knowledge. But how on earth can the absence of anything have sources? 

- Does truth exist? (not discussed here, let's just assume "yes") Whether it is distinguishable from falsity, or in other words, "manifest"? (optimistic versus pessimistic views, similar to the contrast between epistemological traditionalism and rationalism.) How?  

Example of rationalism:
- Descartes's doctrine of the veracitas dei: our intellectual intuition does not deceive us because God is truthful and will not deceive us, i.e. our intellect is a source of knowledge because God is a source of knowledge. (note: René Descartes' Latinized name is Cartesius)

The prisoners in the cave by Plato in Republic:
- "The world of our expirence is only a shadow, a reflection, of the real world. Even if one of the prisoners should escape from the cave and face the real world, he would have almost insuperable difficulties in seeing and understanding it--to say nothing of his difficulties in trying to make those understand who stayed behind." -- summaried by Popper

- "Socrates raised questions but gave no answers; for he confessed that he did not know."--described by Aristotle in Sophist. El., 183b7; cf. Theaetetus, 150c-d, 157c, 161b. He did not teach any belief, but strived to purge or cleanse the soul of its false beliefs.
