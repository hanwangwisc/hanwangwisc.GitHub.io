Karl Popper, Conjectures and Refutations: the Growth of Scientific Knowledge

Introduction- On sources of knowledge and ignorance  

- In this essay, Popper criticised that the doctrine of manifest truth (represented by Bacon and Descartes) was a false epistemology. By saying truth is manifest, he means that truth, if put before us naked, is always recognizable as truth.

- The main point he made in this introduction is to illustrate "sources of ignorance" ( "... I fear, to offend some critical ears..." ). He mentioned a critique from a friend of him: ignorance is the absence of knowledge. But how on earth can the absence of anything have sources? 

- Descartes's doctrine of the veracitas dei: our intellectual intuition does not deceive us because God is truthful and will not deceive us, i.e. our intellect is a source of knowledge because God is a source of knowledge.

- Does truth exist? (not discussed here, it assumes "yes") Whether it is distinguishable from falsity? (optimistic versus pessimistic views) For a typical example, can we always use such "rules" to distinguish truth?
