Claim: $$ S $$ is an ordered set with least upper bound property, then it also has greatest lower bound property.

Proof. Suppose $$ B \in S $$, $$ B \neq \emptyset $$ and B is bounded below.  
Define $$ L $$ as the set of lower bound of $$ B $$. We will show that $$ \alpha = sup L \in S $$ and $$ infB = \alpha \in S $$.  
- $$L$$ is a nonempty subset of $$S$$, which is bounded above by any element in $$B$$. That implies $$ \alpha = sup L \in S $$ by the L.U.P. of $$S$$.  
- (i) Intuition: Any element in $$B$$ is an upper bound of L, s.t., the supremum of $$L$$ is a lower bound of $$B$$. More formally, because $$ \alpha = sup L \in S $$, $$ \forall　\beta<\alpha $$, $$\beta$$ is not an upper bound of L. Thus $$\beta \notin B$$. Using the contrapositive, for every element $$\beta$$ in B, $$\alpha \leq \beta$$.
- (ii) For $$\beta>\alpha$$, $$\beta \notin L$$, i.e., $$ \beta $$ is not a lower bound of $$B$$.

Claim 1 (Archimedean Property of $$R$$) If $$x\in R$$, $$y\in R$$ and $$x>0$$, then there is a positive interger $$n$$ such that $$nx>y$$.

Claim 2 (Denseness of $$Q$$ in $$R$$) If $$x\in R$$, $$y\in R$$ and $$x<y$$, then there exists a $$p\in Q$$ such that $$x<p<y$$.

The topology on the metric space $$M=(A,d)$$ induced by (the metric) $$d$$ is defined as the set $$\tau$$ of all open sets of $$M$$.

"The easiest open set in a metric space are balls; the easiest way to ensure that all points are covered is to use all points as centers; the easiest way to ensure best "granularity" is to allow arbitrarily small radii." – Hagen von Eitzen Sep 4 '12 at 6:22

An interesting example-a compact subset of $$R$$  
Let $$K=\{0\}\cup\{\frac{1}{n}|n=1,2,...\}$$. Show that K is compact.  
Preperation: (1) Archimedean property; (2) Heine-Borel property.  
Proof: Let $$\{G_\alpha\}_\alpha$$ be an open cover of K. Since $$0\in K$$, it is contained in one of the open sets, called $$G_0$$. As we know $$G_0$$ is open, $$\exists \delta>0$$, s.t. $$B(0,\delta)	\subset G_0$$. By Archimedean property, $$\exists N\in N$$, s.t., $$n\geq N \Rightarrow \frac{1}{n}<\delta$$. i.e., $$\frac{1}{n}\in B(0,\delta)	\subset G_0, \forall n\geq N$$. Suppose $$\frac{1}{n}\in G_{n}$$, for $$n\in \{1,2,3,...,N-1\}$$. So there always exists a finite subcover $$ \cup^{N-1}_{\alpha=0}G_\alpha$$.
