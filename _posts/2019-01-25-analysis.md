Claim: $$ S $$ is an ordered set with least upper bound property. Then it also has greatest lower bound property.

Proof. Suppose $$ B \in S $$, $$ B \neq \emptyset $$ and B is bounded below.  
Define $$ L $$ as the set of lower bound of $$ B $$. We will show that $$ \alpha = sup L \in S $$ and $$ infB = \alpha \in S $$.
